Mini game created in vanilla JS. Plan the route and lead the vehicle to the base. The concept is very simple - teaching 2D cartesian coordinates, and you can play with your siblings/nephews/children simply on a chess board, although the game use 10 x 10 board.

```
[
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
[0,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
]
```
